		<h2> Description Of The Website: </h2>
		<div id="desc">
		<p> In this website I will be listing my top 10 favourite games of all time as well as 5 honorable mentions. I will also write some pros and cons, how many hours I have in each game and a short review of the game. When stating my playtime on certain games it will most likely be off because I may or may not have pirated in the past so I won't know the exact playtime so if you see the word "around" I do not know the exact time. Keep in mind that every game on this list that I may or may not have pirated in the past I have bought it and own it now legally. The honorable mentions and reviews can be found by pressing HONORABLE MENTIONS or REVIEWS in the top left corner. My list will most likely have some games that no one else considers them as their favourite games or are typically considered as weird to put on a top 10 list but I don't really care since I enjoy them. Also one last thing, when you click on the images while looking at my list you can visit the game's wiki website.

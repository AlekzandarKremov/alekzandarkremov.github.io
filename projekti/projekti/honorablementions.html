	<h2><u>Honorable Mention Number #1 | Raft |Playtime: 55hours on steam and probably around 40 when it was in beta and not on steam</u></h2>
	<div class="container">
	<a href="https://raft.fandom.com/wiki/Raft_Wiki"><img src="img/raft.jpg" alt="Raft"></a>
	<div class="text">
	<p>So I've played Raft pretty much since it was in beta, and I have to say I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the game, but the reason I didn't put in my top 10 list is because Raft is just simply kind of boring if you don't have anyone to play it with. Don't get me wrong it is still an excellent game but it just feels a little boring to play alone, which is not the case with any of the top 10 games. The story of the game is actually pretty interesting and I LOVE to build in the game. I have made absolutely MASSIVE rafts in the past when playing and I had so much fun making them, until my computer just couldn't handle them and it started lagging. The game is restrictive which means there is a lot of freedom to just do anything you want. Overall I really enjoy the game but there are also things that I dislike about the game.<br>
	Now for some PROS AND CONS.<br>
	<b>PROS first:</b><br>
	+Good graphics<br>
	+Extremely fun gameplay<br>
	+There is quite a lot to do in the game<br>
	+The game is very unique<br>
	+Great building mechanics<br>
	<b>Now time for the CONS:</b><br>
	-There are A LOT of bugs and glitches in the game<br>
	-It can get boring and repetetive<br>
	-It can get boring if you only play by yourself

	<h2><u>Honorable Mention Number #2 | Overwatch 2 |Playtime: a little over 300hours</u></h2>
	<div class="container">
	<a href="https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Overwatch_2"><img src="img/overwatch2.jpg" alt="Overwatch 2"></a>
	<div class="text">
	<p>I started playing Overwatch in mid 2017 and I haven't really played it actively beccause it can get extremely frustrating. I have had countless breaks from the game but in the end I always come back to the game because it is a fun game. Most of the issues I have are with the community and devs. The maps in the game are good but some of them do have issues. Overall the game is mostly fun but it can get very frustrating to play<br>
	Now for some PROS AND CONS.<br>
	<b>PROS first:</b><br>
	+Good graphics and cool little details in the maps<br>
	+Cool characters<br>
	+Very cool story<br>
	+Has fun gamemodes<br>
	<b>Now time for the CONS:</b><br>
	-Push gamemode, the gamemode is boring and it just isn't fun in any way<br>
	-Balance changes, sometimes it feels like the devs are playing an april fools joke on the community with some of their character balance changes because they are absolute trash<br>
	-The community
	-Some of the maps are either attacker or defender sided which means that on some of the maps if you happen to be on the side that isn't that great for that map you will just lose also some of the maps are extremely bad for some characters<br>
	-The ranked system changes that happened when the game transitioned from OW1 to OW2
